# Programming Language Technology (CS4158)

This was a solo project based around building the first few steps of a compiler for the made up language JIBUC. I used Flex and Bison for generating the executable. So far, the lexer and syntax validation (variable size, variable declarations, proper assignment expressions, error messages, etc) have been implemented. The next steps would be to start implementing the generation of an executable for this language.
